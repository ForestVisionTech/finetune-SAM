Progress:
- Tested all different finetune repo and found this one the easiest to work with
- Run with the train_singlegpu_demo and val_singlegpu_demo, worked locally with mobile_sam and sam_vit_b with 8GB vRAM (4070) for both training and inference (Screenshot)

Next steps (suggested):

- [local] setup the python venv for make this repo runable
- [local] Transform our data & put the data with the same format as /datasets here
- [local] try with few images finetuning & evaluation locally
- [local] push to github
- [cloud] change the args back to normal settings
- [cloud] Open Sagemaker notebook & run the full batch modeling training on AWS
